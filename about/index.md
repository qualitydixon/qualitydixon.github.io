Greetings! I'm Mike and I'm a software engineer with a background in physics. I have strong HTML/CSS/Javascript skills and love working with the React ecosystem (React, Redux, React Router, Webpack, etc.). In the past year I've gone through an immense amount of growth, both personally and technically. It all started when I quit a stagnant, big-corp engineering job so I could travel and focus on coding. My journey has taken me from studying Javascript on beaches in Mexico to bulding React applications in the foothills of the Tetons. I've come a long way but, for me, learning never stops. Every day I wake up excited to master a new concept, improve my code, start a new project, or help others.
